      My alias is AN-Drew and my real name is Andr√©s Contreras,
      I like music since I was a kid, and I love rap since I was 11 years old,
      I have to admit that I started listening to rap because of rap-plays, 
      it was my main influence. In fact, my first raps were about videogames 
      (Not ideal, but it is what it is haha). And now I try to put my feelings 
      into lyrics and rap them on a base to show them to the world. Lately I don't 
      dedicate a lot of time to music because I have not been very inspired and 
      I have been dedicating myself to other aspects of my life, but I know that
      whatever happends my love for music and especially rap, will never change.
      So every time I want to express something, I'll do it with a song.
